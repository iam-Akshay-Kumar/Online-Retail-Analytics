## 📈 Key Insights
- UK is the dominant sales market, but other countries show potential.  
- Monthly sales showed strong seasonal growth, peaking in October–November.  
- RFM analysis revealed 48% Champions and 26% Loyal customers, but ~25% were At Risk, needing re-engagement strategies.  
- A few top-selling products (e.g., Paper Craft, Cake Stand) drove a large share of revenue.
